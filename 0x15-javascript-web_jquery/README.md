# jQuery

jQuery is a popular, lightweight, and fast JavaScript library that simplifies the process of interacting with HTML documents, handling events, manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), and making AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests. It was developed to ease the complexities of JavaScript programming and enhance the ease of web development.
